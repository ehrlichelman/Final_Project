# to do:



add connection object to prevent multiple threads using the same connection  
add thread to worker to consume inter-workers communication and test it 
add arguments to workers for routing_key and neighbours list  
  
test bind\unbind functions after inter-workers communication test is passed

replace if-then-else pattern in worker action menu and add basic functionality
